# Compiler Design Practicals

This repository contains the code for the practical experiments conducted as part of the **Compiler Design** subject. These experiments are aimed at understanding various concepts of compilers, such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The code is submitted to **Rahul Choudhary** for evaluation.

## Experiments

### 1. **Reversal Lex**

**Description**:  
This practical involves implementing a lexical analyzer to reverse the characters of each token identified in the input. The program processes the input and applies a character reversal operation to each token it identifies.

**Directory**: `reversal_lex`

---

### 2. **Lowercase to Uppercase**

**Description**:  
This program converts all lowercase letters in the input string to uppercase. It focuses on lexical analysis for character manipulation, converting each lowercase character to its uppercase equivalent.

**Directory**: `lowercase_to_uppercase`

---

### 3. **Find Smallest Word**

**Description**:  
The program identifies and outputs the lexicographically smallest word from the input string. It uses string comparison to find the smallest word and displays it.

**Directory**: `find_smallest_word`

---

### 4. **Binary to Decimal Conversion (Yacc Program)**

**Description**:  
This program takes a binary number as input and converts it to its decimal equivalent using a Yacc parser.

**Directory**: `binary_to_decimal`

---

### 5. **Infix to Postfix Conversion (Lex Program)**

**Description**:  
This program converts an infix mathematical expression to postfix notation. The conversion is done using a lexical analyzer and a stack to handle operators and operands.

**Directory**: `infix_to_postfix`

---

### 6. **Evaluation of Arithmetic Expression (Lex Program)**

**Description**:  
This practical evaluates arithmetic expressions containing operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. It uses a stack to process operands and operators for evaluation.

**Directory**: `eval_arithmetic_expression`

---

### 7. **Palindrome Recognition (Yacc Program)**

**Description**:  
This program checks if a given string is a palindrome. It uses Yacc to define the grammar and processes the input string to determine if it reads the same backward as forward.

**Directory**: `palindrome_recognition`

## Submission

**Submitted to**: Rahul Choudhary

## Usage

1. Navigate to the appropriate directory for the experiment you want to run.
2. Refer to the **README.md** file in each experiment directory for detailed instructions on compiling, running, and testing the programs.
3. Each experiment is self-contained, with necessary files like Lex/Yacc files, C files, and input examples.
